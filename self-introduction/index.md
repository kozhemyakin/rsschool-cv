Hello, my name is Sergey and I am from Belarus. 
I began my journey in IT in 2013 when I completed the Software Testing engineer course by EPAM and became a QA engineer. 
My responsibility as a QA engineer is to prevent and detect bugs in the application. Knowledge in JS helps me to describe and localize bugs in details and reduces the time it takes for developers to understand the problem. Additionally, my knowledge of HTML/CSS helps me to play with tags and styles of the page to make design on the page better and present it to designer for discussion.

I have already been working as a QA engineer for around 9 years, and for the last 2 years, I have been writing autotests using Cypress.js. I started learning JavaScript because I wanted to improve the structure of my autotests. I believe that better knowledge of JS leads to better autotests.

Learning JavaScript has been an impressive experience for me. I have already completed two courses related to JavaScript. The first one was a frontend developer course that focused on React.js. During this course, I developed a web store using React technology. At this web store you could add products to cart, change the qty of the products in the cart, place order, and also write comments for the product. Placed order was saved to database. The second course was pre-school, zero stage at Rolling Scopes school. At Rolling Scopes school, I worked on my first project vanilla js, which called Momentum application. It allows users to set their name and see that name in a greeting at the middle of the page, check the weather of any city, get motivational phrases, and play some music.
I enjoy learning javascript and write code, and aspire to become better at it.

Rolling scopes school is amazing place to improve yor skills. Good luck guys!
